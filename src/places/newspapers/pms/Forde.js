                  An official announcement was made at Canberra on Friday by the Deputy-Prime Minister, Mr.
                  Frank Forde, that on account of his illness it was
                  not likely that Prime Minister Curtin would be able
                  to resume his full duties until January.
                  MR. FORDE, -in his stat _
                  ment, said that he had
                  received fro~a Dr. F.
                  Blois JLawton, medical
                  adviser to the Prime
                  Minister, a report indicating that;
                  : ? Mr. Curtin's health- had become

                  'I ~:n fflad, however, to say,
                  said Mr. Forde, that since
                  entering hospital Mr. Curtin
                  has shown improvement;''
                  The repc :t further, -indicated
                  that complete rest of Mr.. Curtin
                  in hospital' this, month is neces
                  sary, and this must be followed by
                  modified rest during December,

                  some time ir Janup
                  Overtaxed His Endurance.
                  It is known that for some
                  time Mr. Curtin. bad taxed bis
                  - , physical and mental endurance to
                  the utmost, h_s : \ind being .Tilled

                  war effo.; to the exclusion, of ill
                  other interests.
                  If Mr. Curtin had taken -3 ad _
                  ; vice of his doctors he would have
                  taken a prolonged rest . much

                  work.
                  Not Considerate Enough.
                  Down through the years it
                  has been a lamentable fact that
                  the strains of office have been
                  roost marked, upon many of our
                  most brilliant and corscientious
                  Labor represer tatives, and it
                  causes one to think ihat in some
                  respects the Movement is not con
                  siderate enough of the difficulties
                  that some of these meh are esiled
                  upon to face, particularly in times
                  like these, when tremendous re
                  sponsibilities are thrust upon them
                  because of the war. : ,
                  It has bean the practice in Aus

                  At the pre-sessional meeting1 of
                  the Federal Parliamentary Labor
                  Party, which commenced at Can
                  berra; on Monday, contrary to the
                  prognostications of the capitalist
                  press 'lyre birds' and the much
                  publicised expectations of the

                  After , sitting for about three
                  hours in discussing the pro
                  gramme of legislation for the en
                  suing session which opens to-day,
                  the Acting -Prime Minister, Mr.
                  Forde, said that the following
                  motion, moved by himself and
                  seconded by Senator Grant, had
                  been carried unanimously:
                  'This meeting, of the Federal
                  Parliamentary Labor Party ex
                  presses'' to the leader, Mr. John
                  .. Cretin, its deep regret at. his
                  Jpss and offers heartfelt hope
                  ?|pp he will be fully restored to !
                  'health so that he . may, continue ;
                  to lead the Party which he has ?
                  done so ably iri the past nine
                  years.
                  'This meeting extends its
                  congratulations to the leader on
                  the fact that shorfly he will
                  have been Prime Minister longer
                  than any other Labor leader.
                  'This .meeting; expresses ...to,
                  ^.he^ieadfer its; admiration ; of the
                  manner in which he has led the
                  nation through the years of
                  crisis and assures him of its
                  complete support in carrying
                  out the great .tasks that lie ,
                  ahead.'
                  The reference to Mr. Curtin's
                  term of office was prompted by
                  the knowledge that on December
                  2 he will have established a record
                  for continuous service as a Labor
                  Prime Minister. On that date he
                  will have - topped- the previous
                  record of the late Andrew Fisher,
                  who in 1910-13 was Prime Minis
                  ter for three years one month
                  and twenty-six days. '
                  Praise for Britain,
                  After theabove resolution
                  had been carried Mr. Forde
                  reviewed the progress of the war
                  and gave details of bomb attacks
                  on Britain.
                  Caucus then unanimously car
                  ried a resolution which will be
                  forwarded to Prime Minister
                  Churchill praising 'the continued
                  heroic spirit' of the British people
                  and expressing; sympathy in the
                  losses of life suffered as' the re
                  sult of the enemy robot and rocket
                  bombing;
                  On the motion of Senator Mc
                  Kenna, seconded by Dr. Gaha, the
                  Party decided to set up a com

                  Mr. Forde.
                  Mr. Forde, who seems to be 'the
                  'iron man' of the* Cabinet and
                  indefatigable in his activities, will

                  Mr. Forde said that the Prime
                  Minister, Mr. . Curtin, whom he
                  had seen on the previous day, was
                  making satisfactory progress, ' and
                  provided hie carried out the doc
                  tor's instructions to take a
                  month's modified rest, he would
                  be restored to good health.
                  The Session's Business.
                  For the session which opens
                  in Canberra to-day the Govern
                  ment is not expect 2d to introduce
                  any contentious legislation. Legis
                  lation it is expected will ratify the
                  financial agreement with the
                  States and validate sinking-fund
                  payments that have been made by
                  the States since the depression.

                  Government will introduce its pro- .
                  posed legislation on banking, Big .
                  Business appears to be very jit-1
                  tery on the subject, and members
                  may take the opportunity of ex

                  be counted a most significant as
                  pect of Labor policy. Owing' to
                  Mr. Curtin's illness it is not ex
                  pected that the Government's
                  banking legislation will take legis
                  lative form until early in the new
                  year. It is probable that it will
                  be introduced in the session which
                  will begin in February.
